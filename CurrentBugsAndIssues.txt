Need to lower light intensity
Enemies still shoot you when you are dead

AI should react to being shot by turning towards that direction and attempting to find/shoot the player

Player can fall out of the map by walking backwards at the spawn instead of going forwards
BUG: Player can get out of the map and/or go backwards, potentially spawning more blocks than should be spawned. (Because of the large rocks that spawn taller than the walls. Players can just climb them if they spawn in a certain position)
