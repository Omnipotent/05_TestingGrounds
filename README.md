### Testing Grounds Introduction ###

+ Welcome, fresh start, new energy
+ Did you go back and modify Building Escape? 
+ Most ambitious section yet 
+ Bookmark the live Google Slides 
+ Comment on the slides, especially typos 
+ Come say hi at [community.gamedev.tv](https://community.gamedev.tv)

### Code Architecture Storing State ###



### Testing Grounds GDD ###

+ The concept of the game
+ The rules of the game
+ Some of the asset requirements for the game
+ Identify possible technical challenges.

### Using Git LFS (Large File Support) ###

+ The distinction between Git vs GitHub
+ Use Unreal’s toolbar & SourceTree 
+ Enable Git Large File Support (LFS) 
+ Setup on GitHub (no readme.md or initial commit) 
+ Push to GitHub and share
+ Warning: may take a while on slow broadband.

### Marketing & Markdown ###

+ Limitations of Unreal’s connection to GitHub
+ How to reset to previous commit to combine 
+ Presenting your public GitHub page well 
+ Using Markdown to enrich formatting.

### Use git clean to Revert Project ###

+ Upgrading my project to Unreal 4.13
+ An overview of the scene 
+ How the First Person Character is composed 
+ Adding a spiral staircase.

### First Person Character Overview ###



### The Third Person Character ###

+ Add a third person character to the scene
+ Caution about tidying files at this stage 
+ Add a navmesh, and check it’s continuous.

### Introducing AI Behaviour Trees ###

+ Setup a Blueprint AI controller class
+ Behaviour Trees controll AI execution flow 
+ Blackboards hold AI instance data 
+ How to associate a behaviour tree with an AI 
+ Testing that our behavior tree is running.

### Introducing AI Blackboard Data ###

+ Blackboard data is like member variables in code
+ Using blackboard data to set patrol points 
+ Practice setting blackboard values in Blueprint 
+ Test simple AI patrol behaviour.

### Target Points and Patrol Routes ###

+ Add a variable to the NPC’s blueprint
+ How to make a variable an array in blueprint 
+ Introducing Target Point actors 
+ Using target points to specify patrol routes.

### Using Any Actor for Waypoints ###

+ Actors are more general than target points
+ How to select an actor from another actor 
+ Getting the AI Controller to set Blackboard data 
+ Testing our characters go to a set waypoint.

### Options for Grouping Actors ###

+ Use layers (usually used for visibility)
+ Use groups as a simple multi-select tool 
+ Use tags, can be flexible but easy to forget 
+ Use a parent Empty Actor, or a Folder 
+ Group on game object (e.g. array on NPC) 
+ The key is to know the pros and cons.

### Blueprint Behaviour Tree Tasks ###

+ How to use Blackboard Key Selector variables
+ Creating new Tasks in Behaviour Trees 
+ Pseudocode programming in Blueprint 
+ How to use the Execute AI node 
+ How to use the Finish Execute node.

### Modular Arithmetic & Cycles ###



### Performance Profiling 101 ###

+ The first rule of performance: “profile first”
+ Access profiler from Window > Developer Tools 
+ Choose Session Front End 
+ Select your running game session 
+ Chose Profiler tab, and hit Data Preview 
+ Search for your function and double-click.

### C++ AI Behaviour Tree Tasks ###

+ Add “AIModule” and “GameplayTasks” to build
+ Inherit C++ class from **UBTTaskNode**
+ Override **ExecuteTask()**
+ Return **EBTNodeResult::Succeeded;**
+ Don’t try and extend in Blueprint 
+ Use Blueprint XOR C++ for a given task.

### Reading Blackboard Data in C++ ###

+ Expose a blackboard key selector in C++
+ **#include “BehaviorTree/BlackboardComponent.h”**
+ **OwnerComp.GetBlackboardComponent()**
+ Use **GetValueAsInt()** etc to get the value 
+ You can now access blackboard data in C++.

### The Consequences of Inheritance ###

+ We have coupled our AI ChoseNextWaypoint task to the Third Person Character.
+ We have also specialised our Blueprint class with a variable, PatrolPoints. 
+ These dependencies are undesirable, but we will proceed with our conversion.

### Converting Blueprint to C++ ###

+ **OwnerComp.GetAIOwner()** to get AI Controller
+ If you’re casting, you’re probably coupling 
+ Use **.Num()** to get number of elements in **TArray**
+ Use **TODO** for reminders, to help you FOCUS 
+ FOCUS = Follow One Course Until Successful.

### Composition over Inheritance ###

+ We created PatrollingGuard by inheritance
+ How about if we want a patrolling tank? 
+ Another option is to use an actor component 
+ This is an age-old debate 
+ Let’s get some real-world experience of the two 
+ Convert to a component model.

+ The Animation BP controls the animations.

### Changing a Character’s Animation ###
